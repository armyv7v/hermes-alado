# Skills

Agent skills shipped with Alado.

## `alado-companion`

Teaches a bot that it is talked to from **Alado** — the phone PWA — and not from
Hermes Desktop. Alado users have no desktop menus, so the bot must stop sending them to places
that do not exist ("Bots → Screen → Take over") and instead use the Alado flow: open the
exact page, then ask the user to go to their bot profile → **Computadora** → **Ver** /
**Tomar el control** / **Devolver** from the phone. It also tells the bot to hand control over
for logins, 2FA, captchas and payments instead of asking for secrets in chat, and to keep
replies short and phone-friendly.

The skill lives in `skills/alado-companion/`:

- `SKILL.md` — the skill itself (what the model loads).
- `platform-hint.txt` — one line of text that Hermes injects as the TUI platform hint
  (config key `platform_hints.tui.replace`, top-level). It tells the model it is chatting
  through Alado and to load the skill with `skill_view` before answering anything about its
  screen/computer, logins, captchas or 2FA.

It is installed by the provisioner `companion` module (`provisioner/prepare.sh`): the folder is
copied to `~/.hermes/alado-skills/`, merged into every profile's `skills.external_dirs`, the
platform hint is set per profile with `hermes -p <profile> config set --force
platform_hints.tui.replace`, and any legacy marked `<!-- alado:begin/end -->` block in a
profile's `SOUL.md` is removed. See [`docs/provisioner.md`](../docs/provisioner.md).
